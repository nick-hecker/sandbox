# sandbox
Sandbox of parts of code I have used or am developing in various environments
I experiment with a lot of different economic, social, and environment data. This sandbox is just a place for me to place short pieces of code I use for personal and professional products. My analyses are not conducted within a GitHub version controlled environment, and are often conducted ad-hoc.
